This project took forever before the wheels start turning. I spent the majority of lab time stuck on one small problem. As soon as I got the first example of my questions, I was able to adjust and continue on. It felt great being able to add thing, and quasi trouble shoot things. 

I used console.log a lot to troubleshoot. I realize that debug is a better option. I will try using that tomorrow.

I also noticed I don't commit enough and have too may things going on in each commit. I need to commit more and be more detailed about what I do for each commit. I know that if I do that, if in the future I need troubleshoot I can return to a previous commit, 

This assignment took me all of lab time plus 1.5 hours this evening and I am still not done yet. I will finish it this weekend.  When we started this project, I didn't think I was going to be able to get much of anything done. I was afraid I was going to be turning in next to nothing.

Good job, Teonna! Your code looks clean, although your games aren't working completely for me. Your first game is somewhat functional but it doesn't give me the correct feedback even when I put in all the correct answers, and your second game doesn't give me any feedback.

Also, keep in mind about the lab requirements - I'm not seeing any 'use strict' declarations at the top of your JS files, and the functions that you're using in different files aren't being exported. Keep an eye on your linter because it'll clue you in to some of these things.

Fix these issues and resubmit for full credit!
