##Lab-01-ABOUT-ME

At this outset of this lab I was thinking how best to make the HTML content so that multiple entries or array of other people's about me could be brought in together and displayed as a dynamic queue.

I tried tailoring my css minimally to support this and tried to keep all the required info bound as <section></section> elements and only use div tags to format the content into columns. 

Using css then, the setup which may or not be fancy was build out classes like column, row, left and right so that in the HTML markdown, if say I wanted a column on the left side for a given div 
I could simply declare div class = column left which kinda acts as navigation system so I can know what I have done without haveing to ref the HTML and CSS style file.
