    <div id="About">
        <p>This is the moment where Iâ€™m supposed to wow with an incredible talent or hobby, but I simply do not have one of those. And I am a-okay with that. My hobbies are watching the same old shows I have been watching since the early 2000s, reading, crafting (or at least buying supplies to craft with) and perpetually dream building my future home where each day is more like a camping trip than a city excursion. I talk (probably too often) in Gilmore Girls and Harry Potter references and still wish AOL chat rooms existed. I am a knowledge seeker, a list maker and completer, and a believer in giving my all to everything I do.</p>
        
        <p>For the most part you can sum me up by saying I love Gilmore Girls, Harry Potter (ask me about my House), the movie You've Got Mail, and that I really love animals (though I have a severe fondness for Goldendoodles even though cats are my favorite). I do love making decals and canvas signs with my Cricut Maker as well.</p>
