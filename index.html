                    I'm an athlete, musician, dancer, nerd, and a
                    mathematician.  I also thrive off of deep conversations, and I'm a
                    lover of puns!

                    I went to Western Washington University for 5 years and I went in
                    wanting to be an astrophysicist.  I have always loved theoretical physics,
                    the concept of time and space, and what lies beyond the universe.
                    So I went into college with a physics major.  I quickly learned that I couldn't do physics, partly because I had
                    really bad professors, so I switched my major to Electrical Engineering.
                    Unfortunately they required physics as well, so I thought <i>What do I love to do?</i>
                    Math.  I've always loved math and I've always been good at it.  So
                    I switched majors to Math and I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in
                    Mathematics!

                    I have a lot of favorite things in life.  I have a favorite food ( Ice Cream) ,
                    letter ( X ), subject ( Math ), number ( 15 ), and even a car company ( Lamborghini )!
