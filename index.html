    <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Well...letâ€™s see. I really enjoy traveling and seeing new places. I also like to stay up really late and sleeping in past Noon. My hobbies are scrolling through Instagram for too long and watching TV shows that have been off the air for a few decades. I like to walk in the park and breathe fresh air on cold mornings with hot coffee. I think animals are the answer to a happy life and when I see one the rest of the world gets a little quieter. My dream destination is a beautiful piece of forested land that overlooks the ocean, a camp fire and great WiFi.</p>
