About me game

Ask a series of five or more questions about you (based on the content of the html/css section, or not).

You are only required to use text inputs, but feel free to explore checkboxes, radio button groups, select drop downs, text areas, etc.)

When they submit, report how they did (either 4/5 or 80%) along with whatever stylistic feedback you want to give.

Guess an answer game. This one uses the same form submittal to progressively move the user through the game.

If they got it wrong, tell them so, how many guesses left, and ideally a hint

If they got it right, tell them it was completed successfully

If they exhausted all guesses, modify page to show they did not guess in time

If they reset, start the game over

Technical Requirements for "About Me"
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook.

Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed. You need to have the linter running while developing your solution. Make sure to keep the included .travis.yml

Use a separate file for each game (Don't forget to add a <script>)

Your JS file contains a 'use strict' declaration at the top.

Functions used outside each file need to be "exported".

Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; it is evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
